### What is this?

This is a project to complete the MVP required for the second sprint (advanced front-end) of the PUC-Rio university grad school for software development.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"
- See no refresh on any page

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Route hooks
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

Improve semantics of HTML, maybe break down Components into more parts so they are not as big as they are now.
